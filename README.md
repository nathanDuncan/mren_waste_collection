# Autonomous Small Waste Collection Robot
This repostory contains a ROS Noetic package for camera-feed control of the Unitree Go1 Quadraped.

## The Project
This package is part of the MREN403 Mechatronics and Robotics Design Capstone course at Queen's University. This is a year-long project to test the engineering skills of final-year undergraduate students. 
Our project goal is to design an robot capable of autonomous litter collection around the Queen's Campus and downtown Kingston core.
